# Blood Cell Classification Model - Trained on BCCD, CBC, and PBC Datasets

## Intro
Overall goal is to build a model on these various datasets that can detect anomalies in different cell types.

## Next Steps
- [âœ…] Combine the datasets into a single top-level directory
- [] Clean it up and make sure it's good to go for model training
- [] Perform an EDA on the data
- [] Write and implement model - likely a CNN
- [] Train the model
- [] Test the model
- [] Perhaps some parameter tuning, we'll see.
